# Welcome to Hyle team bounty program

The Hyle team is working day and nights on our latest project, Zano blockchain and infrastructure. Meanwhile, we’d like to offer you the opportunity to earn Zano coins while simultaneously increasing its value by fulfilling crucial tasks.
Each task or bounty has different terms and reward, please read careful to maximize your earnings.

## How to become a bounty hunter?
1. Carefully review available tasks [here](https://github.com/AlekseiBo/Test/issues)
2. Pick the right one for you
3. If required leave a comment and wait for approval
3. Go ahead and get it done
4. Once completed the dev team will review and issue the reward

Each bounty can have `Open` or `Closed` status. `Open` means you can apply to take the job in the comment section or submit the results depending on the job description. If bounty has a `Closed` status it means someone else is already working on it and hunters cannot commit to it at the moment. If a hunter working on it doesn’t succeed it will be open again. When job is done the bounty premanently gets closed.

There are labels to help hunters navigate the bounty list. Each bounty is marked with one of the 6 main types: `Videos`, `Articles`, `Social`, `Translations`, `Mining` and `Instructions`. With this labeling system you should be able to easily recognize the tasks you’re looking for.
